# Admin Dashboard 

This project was created as part of the Odin Project's curriculum to gain hands-on experience with CSS grid and SVG usage. Prior to this project, I had only worked with CSS flex, so this was an opportunity for me to expand my knowledge and skills in web development.

It features a sidebar navigation menu, a header section with search and profile options, and a main content area divided into two sections: "Your Projects" and "Announcements & Trending."
